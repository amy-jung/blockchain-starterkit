## History

**Blockchain**
Blockchain is a quite generic system using cryptography and a ledger. The structure of the system allows for immutable transactions. A distributed ledger is usually peer-to-peer and requires consensus for validating new blocks.

*Recommended Play: [BlockchainDemo](https://demoblockchain.org/hash)*


**Bitcoin**
The first blockchain was presented in a whitepaper under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008. The design was implemented into the form of a cryptocurrency called Bitcoin. [Nick Szabo](http://unenumerated.blogspot.com/) is known for ushering in a new concept around "smart contracts" which laid the foundations for Ethereum.

**Ethereum**

Ethereum is an open source, public, Turing-complete, blockchain-based distributed system featuring smart contracts. [Vitalik Buterin](https://vitalik.ca/) wrote the white paper in 2013. Amongst the co-founders is Gavin Wood (Parity Technologies), Charles Hoskinson (Cardano), and Anthony Di Iorio, Joe Lubin (ConsenSys).

**Why it matters now**
- Technology to support intense cryptographic functions is here!
- Data has become a defining "currency"
- Private corporations and software is ruling the world
- Call for financial reform

### **Values**

Blockchain is a means of getting to something. So the shouting you hear is about unlocking/reforming some hefty the values around:

* Identity
* Governance
* Privacy
* Ownership
* Public goods
* Open Source
* Transparency
* Coordination

### **Open Source & Community**

Anyone can make a blockchain, but not everyone can foster a community. What are the values of the blockchain serving as north stars?

### **Current Challenges**

*Recommended Reading: [Why Blockchain is Hard](https://medium.com/@jimmysong/why-blockchain-is-hard-60416ea4c5c)*

**Challenge #1:** Scaling!

Current state: Ethereum is in the middle of moving from current (proof-of-work) system to ETH2.0 (staking) which will require a lot less computation, so you'll see a lot of the development split and in flux. 

Projects tackling this challenge: Near Protocol, Flow (by Dapper Labs)


**Challenge #2:** Hacks, Bugs, Scams

Current state: There's an increase of hacks and scams every year, particularly in decentralized exchanges. One aspect is that due to its complexity and lack of industry experts, there are very few who are able to properly audit systems.

"THE DAO"
"Parity multi-sig"

Projects tackling this challenge: [OpenZeppelin](https://openzeppelin.com/), Trail of Bits


**Challenge #3:** Creating common standards!

Currently: As new blockchains are being created, cross chain interoperability is becoming a bigger need.

Tackling this challenge: Cosmos, Polkadot


## **Ethereum Precursors**

The deeper you are in this stuff, the easier it is to get lost, so this is ordered in: basics at the top. If it's too easy, move ahead! If you're lost, try a step down!

### Decentralized Finance "DeFi" 
Some say it's the leading use case because of all the intermediaries and well, if you've ever tried to send money or live in a volatile economic country, you know why.

Concepts:
* Stablecoin
* Peer to Peer Loans 
* Private Transactions
* Decentralized Exchanges "DEX"

### Foundations 

- Web3 Foundation (Parity Technologies)
- Ethereum Foundation 
    - Ethereum Classic (ETC)
- Bitcoin Foundation 
- Zcash Foundation (Electric Coin Company)


### Events
Events end up being really important and very global because it's a global-first culture (yay open source!). So they become meeting points for teams (some who work together for months/years and never meet til an event)

- [Devcon](https://devcon.org/) - Ethereum's annual gathering.
- [Web3Summit](https://web3summit.com/) - Web3 Foundation's annual event in Berlin.
- [ETHGlobal](https://ethglobal.co/) - Hacking is highly recommended if you're a learn by doing type. Lots of hackers who are new to Ethereum, but also small enough there are OGs available for inquiries. Free to attend, really great people.
- Blockchain weeks (NY blockchain week, SF blockchain week, Berlin blockchain week, etc.) 
- [Stanford Blockchain Conference](https://cyber.stanford.edu/sbc19)(Research focused)
